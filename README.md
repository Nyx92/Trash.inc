# Rocket Academy Coding Bootcamp: Project 2 Trash.inc

1. Install Postgres if you haven't already
    > sudo apt update
    > <br> sudo apt upgrade
    > <br> sudo apt install postgresql
    > <br> sudo apt install postgresql-client
  
2. Set the Postgres server to start in the background
    > sudo service postgresql start
    
3. Install express
    > npm install express

4. Create a database named "trash"

5. Create the necessary tables
    > npm run db:create
    > <br> npm run db:create_recycle
   
6. Start the server and create an account. Code is designed such that the first account created would be designated the admin account. 

WIP:

1. Make sure all links work as intended - presently only base features completed
2. Rework the quantity input of recycle orders
3. Allow users to upload profile picture
